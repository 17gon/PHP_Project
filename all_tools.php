                    A simple calculator provides basic arithmetic functionality for everyday calculations. 
                    It supports four primary operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). 
                    You can also use parentheses to modify the order of operations in more complex expressions. 
                    For example, if you need to calculate 2 + 3 * 5, you would input it as "2 + 3 * 5," 
                    and the calculator will follow the correct order, multiplying 3 and 5 first, then adding 2.

                    An advanced calculator offers much more than basic arithmetic. 
                    It functions similarly to a scientific calculator, providing a range of powerful tools for complex mathematical operations. 
                    In addition to the basic operations (+, -, *, /), it supports advanced functions such as square roots (âˆš), exponentiation (x^y), 
                    and trigonometric functions like sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan). 
                    These functions are essential for those working with more detailed mathematical problems, including geometry, physics, and engineering.
